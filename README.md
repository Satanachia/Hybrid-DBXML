# Hybrid-DBXML
Hybrid implementation of DBXML3.dll

For use with the hybrid DBXML console. 

I'll put more instructions here when I'm not lazy. 

Basically allows one to run the DBXML server for Mabinogi using both SQL database and Local XML file test mode.
This is a tool used to aid in my restoration of the SQL database. 

Using this tool I have been able to place accounts and the character references into the database as well as restore functionality of the Messenger server which relies on the these tables ot be present in a database.
